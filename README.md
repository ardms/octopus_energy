# Work in progress

The purpose of this repository is to host a working code that would read data from [Octopus Energy API](https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/) and would plot them using various python libraries such as [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)

# Instructions

For the code to work you will need an account to Octopus Energy and the properly completed `config.json` file. An Example `config.json` is saved in the root of the project.
